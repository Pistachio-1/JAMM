Math with Pets 

Math with Pets is a educational website for kids. The aim is for children to enjoy learning math and responsibility all at once. Our games encourage a critical thinking approach to mathematics, rather than a memorized one. This has been proven to lead to long term success, as it supports the learning of reasoned decisions and judgements. Math for Pets offers a store where its users can buy pets based off their earnings from playing the games. This aims to teach about responsibility, budgeting and working hard for reward. Simply put, we are dedicated to helping students around the US rise from its mediocre status the STEM fields in a way that is fun, interactive and enjoyable.
